    /* Current Chemical Reactions I am considering using
     * The rust of iron: Redox Rxn
     * Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide: Acid-Base Reaction (do not eat salt)
     * Plant's photosynethesis: CO2 + 6H2O --> C6H12O6
     * Sparkling Water making: H2CO3 eq. CO2 + H2O
     * Make ammonia
     * Use ammonia and react w/ HNO3(just gonna be given) to make ammonium nitrate (a fertilizer)
     * Talked to my chem teacher for this: don't eat salt that's generated from acid-bases, but instead fiter them out of the sea water (we have sea, right?)
